Context: Top-level mode (?)
Pre-conditions: Memory Machine is in initial state, no lights.
Post-conditions: All lights are lit.
Start/Trigger: User pushes a button.
Actors: User, Memory Machine.
Description:
    The user tries out pushing several buttons until one is lit. She then
    tries pushing another button causing the light to go out. She remembers
    the button that lit the first light and pushes this again, trying another
    second button. This time it is the right one, and the user continues in this
    fashion until she finds the complete correct button sequence and all the lights
    are lit.

Description:
    The user tries out pushing several buttons until one is lit. He then
    tries pushing another button causing the light to go out. He remembers 
    the button that lit the first light and pushes this again, trying another
    second button. This time it is the right one, and he tries one more button
    which causes the lights to go out. This time he fails to remember the 
    first two buttons, and his frustration makes him give up.
